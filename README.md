**Folder Structure**
Inside the media directory, you will find:
* top/ folder
* bottom/ folder
* RunningText.txt file

**How It Works**
* Top folder: Content placed here will be displayed on the top section of the screen.
* Bottom folder: Content placed here will be displayed on the bottom section of the screen.
* RunningText.txt: The text inside this file will be displayed as running text between the top and bottom sections.

**Full Screen Display**
If you want to display only one full-screen content:
* Put your media files only in the top folder
* Leave the bottom folder empty

**Supported Media Files**
You can place images or videos, for example:
* .jpg, .png
* .mp4

**File Naming Rules**
The display order follows the numbering sequence (ascending).
All media files must use numeric filenames, such as:
1.jpg
2.mp4
3.png
